<h1>Flint Water Crisis: Analytical Model for Lead Pipe Identification

<h2>Description</h2>
The Flint Water Crisis of 2014 endangered the lives of residents and necessitated the tracking and replacement of lead-based water distribution systems. Given limited financial resources and incomplete documentation, the city of Flint faced challenges in identifying parcels with lead service lines. This project addresses these challenges by developing an analytical model to prioritize parcels most likely to contain lead pipes, aiding in the inspection and replacement process.
<br />


<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Tableau</b> 
- <b>JMP</b>

<h2>Objective</h2>

To create a data-driven model using a dataset of over 20,000 Flint parcels to:

- <b>Identify parcels likely to contain lead pipes.</b> 

- <b>Optimize the inspection process by targeting high-risk areas.<b>

- <b>Support the cityâ€™s efforts to eliminate lead-based service lines.<b>
